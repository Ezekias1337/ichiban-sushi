        In addition to the great food, the service is great! The staff is attentive and friendly.
        Give Ichiban a try, they wonâ€™t disappoint!`,

      reviewBody: `First of all, itâ€™s amazing that we have a sushi all-you-can-eat spot in Greer. The restaurant is very nice and cozy. This is definitely a great date spot, without the pressure of having to make a reservation.
        I ordered edamame, sesame balls, tuna tataki, yellowtail jalapeÃ±o, rainbow roll, Naruto, and mango mochi. The edamame was perfectâ€”not mushy but crispy. The sesame balls were also crispy, and the quality of the fish was really good.
        I will definitely be returning. Itâ€™s so convenient that itâ€™s so close to home!`,

      reviewBody: `I just had the BEST vegetarian ramen from this place! The restaurant is pretty big with enough parking. There is of course, a large sushi selection, but the vegetarian ramen was so flavorful and perfect. I was completely taken aback!
        My friend got the mango tango sushi and it was also pretty good. I would highly recommend Ichiban Sushi for some good Japanese food in Greer!`,
