        In addition to the great food, the service is great! The staff is attentive and friendly.
        Give Ichiban a try, they wonâ€™t disappoint!`,

      reviewBody: `First of all, itâ€™s amazing that we have a sushi all-you-can-eat spot in Greer. The restaurant is very nice and cozy. This is definitely a great date spot, without the pressure of having to make a reservation.
        I ordered edamame, sesame balls, tuna tataki, yellowtail jalapeÃ±o, rainbow roll, Naruto, and mango mochi. The edamame was perfectâ€”not mushy but crispy. The sesame balls were also crispy, and the quality of the fish was really good.
        I will definitely be returning. Itâ€™s so convenient that itâ€™s so close to home!`,
